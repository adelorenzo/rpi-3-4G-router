# RPi 3/4G router with smart WiFi autoswitch
scripts for the RPi 3/4G router with smart WiFi autoswitch

This is a project I am very proud of. It is a wireless router that turns off the 3/4G modem when it connects to a known WiFi network. It'll turn the modem back on if it disconnects from the WiFi network. It is portable and has a UPS that lasts approximately 8 hours (mileage may vary).

Below are the custom scripts I wrote for this project. Installation details here: https://adolfo.delorenzo.tech/index.php/2019/10/31/raspberry-pi-3-4g-router-with-wifi-autoswitch/
